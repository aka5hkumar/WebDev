	<h3>What is there really to say? Lorem ipsutem... or whatever it is?
I, like everyone else, am just trying to figure it all out. I am trying
to find my way in the world, and see where the decisions I have
made will take me. I am in the persuit of having an impact,
somewhere somehow. Working on that, that is my greatest goal,
but achieving it, that could be far more difficult. </h3>
